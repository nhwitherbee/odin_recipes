    <h1>Nick's Miso Soup</h1>
    <img src="images/Miso_Soup-100x100.jpg" alt="Steaming hot bowl of delicious Miso Soup">
    <h3>Why is it so good?</h3>
        <p>It's so warm and comforting and savory, with perfect little bites of tofu and seaweed in every scoop. Up until now I’ve reserved miso for times when we go out to eat. But when I was feeling a little under the weather recently, miso sounded soooo good to my achy stomach. That, along with a strong sushi craving, inspired me to create some of my own.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups Vegetable Broth</li>
        <li>1 sheet nori</li>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp white or yellow miso paste (use Brown Miso for ultimate flavor bomb!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green chard or other sturdy green</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firm tofu</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Cook:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place vegetable broth in a medium sauce pan and bring to a low simmer.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, place miso (starting with lesser end of range) into a small bowl, add a little hot water and whisk until smooth. This will ensure it doesn’t clump when added to the soup later. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To the broth add chard (or other greens of choice), green onion, and tofu (if using silken, add at the end of cooking) and cook for 5 minutes. Then add nori and stir. Remove from heat, add miso mixture, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Taste and add more miso or a pinch of sea salt if desired. Serve warm. Best when fresh.</li>
    </ol>
