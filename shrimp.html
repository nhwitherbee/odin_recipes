    <h3>What's the deal?</h3>
        <p>This shrimp recipe makes the perfect midweek meal or quick appetizer because the ingredients are simple and there’s minimal cook time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup sweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>1 pound raw large shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached</li>
        <li>3–4 Tablespoons vegetable oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon finely chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with 3 medium bowls. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in one. Beat the eggs in the second bowl. Combine Panko and coconut in the third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip the shrimp into the flour, then the eggs, and then dredge the shrimp into the coconut mixture, pressing gently to adhere. You want a lot of coconut on each shrimp. Set the coated shrimp aside on a plate as you coat the remaining shrimp.</li>
        <li>Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the coconut shrimp in batches such as 7-8 shrimp at a time– do not crowd them in the pan. Flip after 2 minutes and fry the other side for 2 minutes or until golden brown. We prefer ours a little darker, so I fry each side for about 2:30-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the finished coconut shrimp on a plate lined with a paper towel as you fry the rest. Sprinkle with finely chopped cilantro. Mix dipping sauce ingredients together and serve with shrimp.</li>
    </ol>
